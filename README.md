Abstract

We propose a sequence-to-sequence model to capture a partial trajectory that contains a few attractive local regions and forecast its destination. Therefore, the main goal of this work is to predict the destination, given the tripâ€™s trajectory, effectively by learning from its attractive local sub-trajectory only. Conceptually, the proposed model incorporates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) for finding frequent trip trajectories and a Consecutive Attractive Local Regions (CALR) mechanism for only taking their few attractive local regions, called CALR-BiLSTM. Existing related works focused on observing whole regions of each trip trajectory at once to decide its attractive ones from a Global Attention Mechanism (GAM). However, GAM may hold similar attractive sub-trajectories for different destinations, which leads to worse predictions. To overcome the issue, the proposed model observes the entire trip trajectory part by part within a small window, such as focusing on a few regions that are attractive. In this work, we demonstrated the proposed model on large public datasets. As a result, we can enjoy the proposed model as the winner against the state-of-the-art models. Moreover, we present ablation studies on various recurrent neural networks and attention mechanisms to ensure the proposed model is in the right settings.
